# Time Series Data Visualization and Analysis

This Jupyter Notebook project focuses on exploring and visualizing time series data related to global average daily temperatures across various cities from 1995 to 2020. The main goal is to enhance understanding of trends, outliers, and patterns using effective visualization techniques.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset used contains **average daily temperatures** of multiple cities around the globe, spanning **1995 to 2020**.

## 📌 Objectives
- Understand time series data and its structure
- Learn how to preprocess time series datasets
- Explore temperature trends over the years
- Compare temperature patterns across different regions
- Visualize monthly trends in specific countries like Canada

## 🗂️ Agenda
1. Importing the dataset
2. Preprocessing and cleaning
3. Global temperature analysis (1995–2019)
4. Comparing yearly average temperatures by region
5. Monthly average analysis in Canada

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- **Python** (pandas, numpy)
- **Plotly** (for interactive plots)
- **Matplotlib** (for static graphs)

## 📈 Key Visualizations
- Line charts
- Bar charts
- Box plots
- Interactive maps and trend lines

## 🔍 Insights
- Identifying overall trends in global temperature rise
- Spotting seasonal patterns and temperature variability
- Comparing climate behavior across continents

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Open the notebook file in Jupyter or Google Colab
2. Make sure the dataset is in the correct path (or upload it)
3. Run cells in sequence to see the visualizations and insights
